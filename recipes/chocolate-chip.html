        <h2>Chocolate Chip Cookies Recipe</h2>
        <p>
          Chocolate chip cookies are a traditional favorite. These cookies are
          great to have as a snack, to make with your kids, or share with family
          and friends. These cookies are best with the company of a tall glass
          of milk or a friend. You really can't go wrong with bringing chocolate
          chip cookies to a party.
